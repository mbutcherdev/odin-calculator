# Odin Calculator

A HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation of a Calculator, hosted [here](https://calc.mbutcher.dev). 




## Features

- Chain inputs/calculations
- Does calculations positive and negative
- Percentages work correctly
- Multiple refactors backend


## Difficulties/Learning opportunities

Final fundamentals project for TOP. Logic was reworked 3-4 times, coming from Python to JavaScript. Overall the calculator works as intended, had slight issues with how to store the values to produce multiple calculations.   
Managed to create the percentage so it would automatically do the correct calculation (100 - 25% results in 75 etc) and continue to be used within the chain without resetting everything

- Improvements in working with JavaScript and many functions
- Experience with HTML/CSS selectors
- DOM manipulation using JavaScript
- Improving commit history, as per recent interview feedback
